# BozoStopWatch


Super basic StopWatch that starts at 0 and counts up. It can do basic commands with start and stop. Currently working on making a button that starts at 10 minutes and counts up.

I worked on this with some friends, we call it Bozo StopWatch because we always get distracted while trying to be productive and we wanted to keep track of how much time we get distracted for.

Worked on with @samuelmcdonald and @saljooghis19
